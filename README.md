# ✨ MyFileManager ✨

Simple but effective file manager, because I'm lazy 💤. I keep downloading a lot of stuff I don't need
and I'm getting lost in them.


## Usage

[Download](https://github.com/Madapiw/MyFileManager) as you wish, python file or exe.

Run with python 3.9 🐍 or greater, or just click the executable file in the folder you intend to organize.

To run daily use cron on Linux or in task schedule on Windows as you with.
